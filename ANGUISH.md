I am not saying the model is bad, but it is so confusing
Why do I need client commands and server commands?
It is because server commands accept any data, not only strings; and client commands are ones that can be typed at the command prompt, that's why.
It is resourceful. If you don't like server commands, just ignore them and implement a client commands layer for each singl server command.
No. If it is not obvious, it is bad. I gotta modify this, turn this into something that can be understood.

commands.send_image --> client.send_message_with_attachments --> servercommands.

I am going to see through this!
This is really important

I am going to build this lib, but pa単単a is going to be an exception.
I already had this deal with myself, that I would not touch pa単単a, that it wouldn't use
a lib, OK? OK. It is what it is. It works, why should I break it?
Why do I always struggle between different ways to do things? The great is the enemy of the good

OK, I think I got this working.

There is a difference between _on_initialize() and _do_initialize(). They both clearly name methods that can be overriden. But the former is optional and is called in the middle of other stuff happening, whereas the latter is responsible for doing something important, it is relied on. THe first one is like: "if you need to perform something at this point in the program execution, we let you put it inside this method", whereas the latter is like: "you better figure out how to do this or let me do it in some default way"
